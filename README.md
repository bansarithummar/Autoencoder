Greedy Layer-Wise Unsupervised Pretraining Protocol,

1. Initialize Parameters: Initialize the parameters of the first layer's unsupervised model (e.g., Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Autoencoder).

2. Pretrain First Layer: Train the first layer's unsupervised model using the raw input data.

3. Extract Features: Extract features from the trained first layer's model.

4. Initialize Next Layer: Initialize the parameters of the next layer's unsupervised model using the extracted features as input.

5. Pretrain Next Layer: Train the next layer's unsupervised model using the features extracted from the previous layer.

6. Repeat: Repeat steps 3-5 for each subsequent layer until all layers are pretrained.
